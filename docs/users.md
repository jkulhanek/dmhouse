# Users guide

This documentation is for users who wish to run **DeepMind Lab's** included
[levels](/docs/levels.md) against user-written
agents.

To learn about them, try
[running levels as a human](/docs/users/run_as_human.md).

Once you've written your own agent, you move on to
[running levels from a script](/docs/users/run_from_script.md).

For information on how to develop your own levels, please see the
[developers](/docs/developers.md) documentation.
