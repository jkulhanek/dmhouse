// A C-language RL environment interface.
//
// An environment exposes this API by returning an opaque context and filling in
// the function pointer fields of an EnvCApi object. Users can then interact
// with the environment by calling those function pointers and passing the
// context along.
//
// The functions pointed to by the EnvCApi fields shall satisfy the requirements
// that are described below.
//
// The file env_c_api_example.cc shows an example environment and bindings to
// this API.
//
//
// RL Environment Basics
// ---------------------
//
// An *environment* in the sense of this API is a state which evolves in
// discrete steps. At every step, an external *agent* may perform *actions*
// on the environment. The agent may also request a set of *observations*
// from the environment at any point, and query for *events*.
//
// An action consists of a tuple of discrete (integral) values and a tuple
// of continuous (floating-point) values. The sizes of both these tuples
// makes up the "shape" of the action, which can be queried through the API.
//
// An observation consists of a multidimensional array of either ints or
// doubles. This "shape" of the observation is described by an "observation
// spec", which is part of the observation. (However, the API may additionally
// expose a fixed spec that is always valid, which simplifies observation
// handling for the caller.) The environment returns a tuple of observations,
// whose size can be queried through the API.
//
// An event is an optional piece of data (see below).

///////////////
//  The API  //
///////////////

// General remarks
//
// Terminology: the phrase "any other API call" is a shorthand for "any call
// of any other function in this concrete API object with the same context".
//
// Several functions produce pointer values that become invalidated by "any
// other API call". (This allows implementations to use a fixed storage for
// those values.)
//
// All functions shall be called with a valid context, that is, a context that
// was created successfully and has not been passed to release_context. (This
// API does not specify how contexts are created.)
//
// All functions that take pointer parameters shall be called with corresponding
// valid and non-null arguments. Functions that return pointers to const char
// shall not return null.
//
// Returned pointers never convey ownership; the implementation manages the
// resources of all exposed objects.

  // same key is used more than once, the last key-value pair is used. This
